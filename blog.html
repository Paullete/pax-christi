    <h1>West Papua Human Rights Crisis</h1>
    <div class="article">
        <p>In December 2024, civil society organizations across the Pacific called upon regional leaders to address ongoing human rights violations in West Papua. Reports indicate that approximately 70,000 Papuans remain displaced due to military operations, with numerous instances of torture, discrimination, extrajudicial killings, and unlawful arrests.</p>
        <p>Between January and September 2024, over 1,300 human rights violations were documented, including arbitrary detentions, suppression of peaceful assemblies, and infringements on freedom of expression. These organizations emphasize that addressing these injustices is not only a matter of human rights but also essential for regional stability and reconciliation.</p>
        <p>They urge Pacific leaders to take responsibility and engage in constructive dialogue to promote peace and justice in West Papua.</p>
